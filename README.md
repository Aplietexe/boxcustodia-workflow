A landing page I made for a client as a freelancer.

I adhered to the pixel to the design I was provided with, adding a sidebar and some animations as extras, as they seemed necessary and the client agreed.

The project uses create-react-app, Bootstrap and styled-components along with some utility libraries.

For tooling, it uses Babel, TypeScript, ESLint and Prettier.

[Live version](https://boxcustodia-workflow.vercel.app).

Some time after this project was done, I was tasked with migrating it to Next.js. The repo with that project is [here](https://github.com/Aplietexe/boxcustodia-workflow-next).
